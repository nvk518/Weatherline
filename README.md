### Weatherline is trip planning service that details the weather for each day of your trip. Have the weather for each city you're visiting be listed on the day you visit.

### Demonstration: In progress

### Developer TODO plans
 * Add average weather (high) and average weather (low) for trip
 * Implement a summary of weather along with key weather details that might affect the trip (ie. "Rain on trip" or "High heat warning")
 * Advise the user what to pack, use machine learning to predict what might be needed based on weather
 * Incorporate even more details, such as weather at different times of the day
 * Allow for multiple cities to be added to one day -- useful when visiting more than one city on a particular day
